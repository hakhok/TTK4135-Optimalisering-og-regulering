[[4.3 Linear Quadratic control]]

In the above section the optimal controller was an LTV controller. It will now be made even easier with a constant feedback gain: $u_t=-Kx_t$.

##### State feedback
If $A, B, Q$ and $R$ do not vary with time, its possible to find a constant feedback gain $K$.

If the system is _stabilizable_ there will always exist a well defined solution. Stabilizability is a weaker form of controllability. It means that at least all unstable modes if a system is controllable.
