Dynamics systems are systems that changes over time, meaning that variables are a function of time. Static systems are time independent. The main ways to optimize a dynamic system is _Quasi dynamic optimization_ and _Dynamic optimization_:

- Quasi dynamic optimization
	- Slow dynamic changes can be compensating for by frequently reoptimizing on a static model.
- Dynamic optimization
	- Optimize on a dynamic model. The solution will be a function of time, i.e. all decision variables will be functions of time. Dynamic optimization is necessary when dynamics play a major role.
