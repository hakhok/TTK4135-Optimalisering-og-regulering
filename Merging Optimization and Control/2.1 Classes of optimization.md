Mathematical optimization problems contains:
- Objective function
- Decision variables
- Constraints
Nonlinear program:
$$
	min f(Z)
$$
Subject to:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\begin{array}{ll}
c_i(z)=0, & i \in \mathcal{E} \\
c_i(z) \geq 0, & i \in \mathcal{J}
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

The feasible region, or the feasible set, are defined by the constraints $c_i$. The feasible set is defined by:
$$
\Omega=\left\{z \in R^n \mid\left(c_i=0, i \in \mathcal{E}\right) \wedge\left(c_i \geq 0, i \in \mathcal{J}\right)\right\}
$$
A point $z^* \in \Omega$ is the solution is:
$$
f\left(z^*\right) \leq f(z), \forall z \in \Omega
$$

A local solution is the solution within a neighborhood, and is defined by:
$$
f(z^*)\leq f(z), \forall z \in ||z-z^*||<\epsilon
$$
A strict local solution is defined by replacing $\leq$ with $<$.

Provided certain smoothness conditions and regularity conditions are satisfied, the KKT conditions define necessary conditions for optimality.

Lagrange function:
$$
\mathcal{L}(z,\lambda) = f(z)-\sum \lambda_ic_i(z)
$$
Where $\lambda_i$ are the Lagrange multipliers.

An active constraint is a constraint for which $c_i=0$. That means all equality constraints are active at a feasible point. An inequality constraint may be active or not active at a feasible point.
