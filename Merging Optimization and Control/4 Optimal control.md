Bridge the gap between dynamic optimization and control.
- _Model Predictive Control_, merges feedback control with dynamic optimization.
- Linear MPC in which a convex QP problem is the core component.
- The linear MPC can be relaxed by removing inequality constraints. This is known as the _linear quadratic_ controller where the solution is given by a linear controller.
- _Nonlinear MPC_, which uses a dynamic model.
