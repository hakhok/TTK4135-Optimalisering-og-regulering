A discrete time system is sampled at discrete points in time. Can be described by a finite difference model:
$$
x_{t+1}=g(x_t,u_t)
$$
_Note that_ $x_t$ _means discrete time while_ $x_k$ _means iteration_.

The linear time invariant equivalent:
$$
	x_{t+1}=Ax_t+Bu_t
$$
The linear time variant:
$$
x_{t+1}=A_tx_t+B_tu_t
$$
