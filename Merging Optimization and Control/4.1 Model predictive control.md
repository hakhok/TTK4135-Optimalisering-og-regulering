In [[3.3 Dynamic optimization with linear models]] we saw dynamic optimization, where a discrete time model is optimized from $t = 0$ to $t=N.$ This is an open loop optimization problem since there is no feedback in the solution.

_Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant._

#algorithm
### State feedback MPC procedure
```python
for t in [0,...,N]:
	x_t = get_current_state()
	u_t = solve_optimization_problem(x_t)
	apply(u_t)
```
The algorithm solves a similar optimization problem over and over again at each time step. Hence, MPC uses a _moving horizon_ approach.

MPC couples open loop optimization with feedback control in the following way: _At each time step MPC requires a new solution of the dynamic optimization problem._
